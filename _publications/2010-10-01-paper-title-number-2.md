A core assumption of explainable AI systems is that explanations change what users know, thereby enabling them to act within their complex socio-technical environments. Despite the centrality of action, explanations are often organized and evaluated based on technical aspects. Prior work varies widely in the connections it traces between information provided in explanations and resulting user actions. An
important first step in centering action in evaluations is understanding what the XAI community collectively recognizes as the range of information that explanations can present and what actions are associated with them. In this paper, we present our framework, which maps prior work on information
presented in explanations and user action, and we discuss the gaps we uncovered about the information presented to users.
